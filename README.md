This is the python code and notebooks used to generate the plots of the paper
"From motor to visually guided bimanual affordance learning"
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/1059712319855836

The code is old and only compatible with Python 2.7
It uses an old version of the Python Robot simulations of:
https://github.com/santmarti/PythonRobot2DSim

A cleaned improved version of the robot simulation library 
compatible with Reinforcement Learning code is soon going to be uploaded.

A video of the bimanual task can be found at:

Requirements:
-pybox2d library: can be installed via openai gym:  pip install -e '.[box2d]'
-explauto library: https://github.com/flowersteam/explauto
-pygame library: for executing visualization of ArmPyGameLearn.py
